Due to Covid 19, I had time to finish 100% complete a great game on my PS4, that is [God of War](https://godofwar.playstation.com/).

This is also my first ever trophy also, I was so glad to share this moment to [Vietnamese PS4 community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ps4vietnam/).

Before that I always finish the story line then stop playing, but to get platinum trophy is a different story. I have to Google and Youtube so much to get through sub-quests.

Hope will get more platinum trophies :D.
